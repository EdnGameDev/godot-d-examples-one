Godot-D
=======
D language bindings for the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)'s
[GDNative API](https://github.com/GodotNativeTools/godot_headers).

**WIP**: These bindings are still under development. Not all of the design,
implementation, or documentation is final. Comments/suggestions are welcome
(see GitHub issues).

Usage
-----
#### Dynamic library
Create a [DUB project](https://code.dlang.org/getting_started) with `godot-d`
as a dependency and `targetType` set to `dynamicLibrary`.

The compiled library should go in your Godot project's folder. Depending on how
your folder is set up, you can use the `targetPath` setting in your DUB project
to automate this.

In the Godot editor, create a GDNativeLibrary resource and specify the path to
your library for each platform you'll compile the library for.

#### D native scripts
In Godot, a "script" is an object that exposes methods, properties, and signals
to the engine. It is always attached to one of the engine's own C++ classes,
listed in the [class reference](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/).  
To expose a D class to the engine as a native script, inherit from GodotScript
with the Godot class the script should be attached to:  
```D
import godot, godot.button;

class TestButton : GodotScript!Button
{
	...
}
```
GodotScript contains a pointer to the Button the script is attached to, called
`owner`, which can be used to call Button methods or passed to methods taking
Button as an argument. The `owner` manages the lifetime of the script.

Normal OOP inheritance and polymorphism can be simulated by simply adding
`alias owner this;` to the D script class. For low-level code, just keep in
mind that `owner` is a separate C++ object.

#### Initialization
Your D scripts still need to be registered into Godot when your library is
loaded by the engine. The GodotNativeInit/Terminate templates will generate
the C interface for you; instantiate them with the list of script classes to
add to Godot (at initialization) and functions to be called:  
```D
mixin GodotNativeInit!
(
	TestButton,
	(){ writeln("GodotNativeInit func"); }
);

mixin GodotNativeTerminate!( (){ writeln("GodotNativeTerminate func"); } );
```

#### Godot API
Godot's full [script API](http://docs.godotengine.org/) can be used from D:  
- `godot.core` submodules contain container, math, and engine structs like
  `Vector3` and `String`.
- other submodules of `godot` contain bindings to Godot classes, auto-generated
  from the engine's API. These are the C++ classes scripts can be attached to.

Building Godot-D
----------------
The DUB package will only be updated for official releases of Godot, but if you
keep Godot up-to-date with `master` branch, you can make a local clone of
Godot-D and generate updated bindings using the [API generator](generator/README.md).

[DUB](https://code.dlang.org/getting_started) has various ways of using your
modified local Godot-D package, or you can simply include the contents of `src`
and `classes` in your own project instead of a DUB dependency.
